# Task Manage - v2 WIP

A task management app built with React. This is a rebuild of a previous attempt of this application.  

## To Do
[] Add validations  
[] Load individual user cards and column
[] Refactor, check current functions and add comments   
[] Login functionality  
[] Responsive design  

Version 2  
[] Editing column names - Adding v4uuid is refreshing each time I try to edit the column and preventing editing functionality. Look into way to give button and div individual key and remove warnings -- TO DO ON NEXT VERSION ONCE INITIAL VERSION IS READY  
[] Update styles so scolling works on x & y axis  
[] BACKEND - Delete the cards in that column  
[] Change 'user' to select menu - Select from currently registered users
