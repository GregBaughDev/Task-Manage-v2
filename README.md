# Task Manage
## A task management app built by Greg Baugh
v1.2

A task management app built with React. 
The app is built using the MERN stack and is my second attempt at this project.
I originally developed the project using drag and drop functionality and the code incorporated both class based and functional components due to the drag and drop library. I decided to rebuild
this project using solely functional based components and hooks.

## Technologies used
HTML, React, Node, MongoDB, Styled Components, Figma
